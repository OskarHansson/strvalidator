## Resubmission
This is a resubmission.

* In this version I have spelled out the abbreviations caught as possibly mis-spelled words.

* The two links caught as possibly invalid URLs are now up and running.
  The first had a temporary problem, while the second was down for maintenance.

* In addition the second link (enfsi) was changed to link directly to the specific document.

## Test environments
* local Windows 7 (64-bit) install, R 3.1.3, RStudio 0.98.1073
* win-builder: devel (2015-06-08 r68489) and release version 3.2.0 (2015-04-16)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs. 

There was 2 NOTEs:

* checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE
Maintainer: 'Oskar Hansson <oskar.hansson@fhi.no>'

  Maintainer address is correct.

Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:
  ENFSI (19:68)
  STR (4:60, 17:13)
  SWGDAM (21:6)

  Abreviations are are correct.
  
* checking package dependencies ... NOTE
  No repository set, so cyclic dependency check skipped
  
  This NOTE was not in the development version. Should be ok.
  
## Downstream dependencies
There are currently no downstream dependencies for this package.
