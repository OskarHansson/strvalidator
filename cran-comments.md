## Resubmission

This is a resubmission.

In this version I have removed the 'choose.dir' call from the 'import' function (it is Windows specific).

## Test environments
* local Windows 7 (64-bit) install, R 3.2.2, RStudio 0.99.473
* win-builder: devel r69224 (2015-08-30) and release version 3.2.2 (2015-08-14)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs. 

There was 1 NOTE for the local build:

* checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE
Maintainer: 'Oskar Hansson <oskar.hansson@fhi.no>'

  Maintainer address is correct.

## Downstream dependencies
There are currently no downstream dependencies for this package.
