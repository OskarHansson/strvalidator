strvalidator is a package developed for validation and process control of methods and instruments in a forensic genetic laboratory. The graphical user interface STR-validator make it easy to analyse data in accordance with European Network of Forensic Science Institutes (ENFSI) and Scientific Working Group on DNA Analysis Methods (SWGDAM) validation guidelines.\n\n

In order to assure correct results, most of the core functions are extensively validated using the 'testthat' package before a new version is released (see STR-validator webpage for details).\n\n

STR-validator is a product of the PhD work performed by Oskar Hansson (thesis available at the STR-validator website), which was partly funded by the European Union seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement no 285487 (EUROFORGEN-NoE).\n\n
