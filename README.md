strvalidator
============

strvalidator is a package developed for validation and process control of methods
and instruments in a forensic genetic laboratory. The graphical user
interface STR-validator make it easy to analyse data in accordance with European
Network of Forensic Science Institutes (ENFSI) and Scientific Working Group on DNA
Analysis Methods (SWGDAM) validation guidelines.

In order to assure correct results, most of the core functions are extensively
validated using the 'testthat' package before a new version is released (see
STR-validator webpage for details).

STR-validator is a product of the PhD work performed by Oskar Hansson (thesis
available at the STR-validator website), which was partly funded by the European
Union seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement 
no 285487 (EUROFORGEN-NoE).
