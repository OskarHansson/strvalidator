strvalidator
============

STR-validator is a free and open source R-package intended for process control and internal validation of
forensic STR DNA typing kit.
Its graphical user interface simplifies the analysis of data exported from e.g. GeneMapper software,
without extensive knowledge about R. It provides convenient functions to import, view, edit,
and export data. After analysis the results, generated plots, heat-maps, and data can be saved in a project
for easy access. Currently, analysis modules for stutter, balance, dropout, mixture, and concordance are available. STR validator can greatly increase the speed of validation by reducing the time and effort needed for analysis of the validation data.
It allows easy exploration of the characteristics of DNA typing kits according to ENFSI recommendations.
This facilitates the implementation of probabilistic interpretation of DNA results.

STR-validator is written and maintained by Oskar Hansson, senior forensic scientist at the Norwegian Institute 
of Public Health (NIPH), Department of Forensic Biology. The work has received external funding from the European
Union seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement no 285487 (EUROFORGEN-NoE)
but development and maintenance are also performed as a part of my position at NIPH, and on personal spare time.
