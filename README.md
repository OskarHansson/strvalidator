strvalidator
============

STR-validator is a free and open source R-package intended for process control
and internal validation of forensic STR DNA typing kit.
Its graphical user interface simplifies the analysis of data exported from e.g.
GeneMapper software, without extensive knowledge about R. It provides 
functions to import, view, edit, and export data. After analysis the results,
generated plots, heat-maps, and data can be saved in a project for easy access.
Currently, analysis modules for stutter, balance, dropout, mixture, concordance,
typing result, precision, pull-up, and analytical thresholds are available. In addition there are functions to analyse the GeneMapper bins- and panels files. EPG like plots can be generate from data. STR-validator can greatly increase the speed of 
validation by reducing the time and effort needed to analyse the validation
data. It allows exploration of the characteristics of DNA typing kits according
to ENFSI and SWGDAM recommendations. This facilitates the implementation of 
probabilistic interpretation of DNA results.

STR-validator was written and is maintained by Oskar Hansson, senior forensic
scientist at Oslo University Hospital (OUS), Section for Forensic Genetics.
The work initially received external funding from the European
Union seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement no
285487 (EUROFORGEN-NoE) but development and maintenance is now performed as 
a part of my position at OUS, and on personal spare time.
