\usage{
calculateDropout(
  data,
  ref,
  threshold = NULL,
  method = c("1", "2", "X", "L"),
  ignore.case = TRUE,
  sex.rm = FALSE,
  qs.rm = TRUE,

}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data frame in GeneMapper format containing at least a column 'Allele'.}

\item{ref}{data frame in GeneMapper format.}

\item{threshold}{numeric, threshold in RFU defining a dropout event.
Default is 'NULL' and dropout is scored purely on the absence of a peak.}

\item{method}{character vector, specifying which scoring method(s) to use.
Method 'X' for random allele, '1' or '2' for the low/high molecular weight allele,
and 'L' for the locus method (the option is case insensitive).}

\item{ignore.case}{logical, default TRUE for case insensitive.}

\item{sex.rm}{logical, default FALSE to include sex markers in the analysis.}

\item{qs.rm}{logical, default TRUE to exclude quality sensors from the analysis.}

\item{kit}{character, required if sex.rm=TRUE or qs.rm=TRUE to define the kit.}

\item{debug}{logical indicating printing debug information.}
}
\value{
data.frame with columns 'Sample.Name', 'Marker', 'Allele', 'Height', 'Dropout',
'Rfu', 'Heterozygous', and 'Model'.
Dropout: 0 indicate no dropout, 1 indicate allele dropout, and 2 indicate locus dropout.
Rfu: height of surviving allele.
Heterozygous: 1 for heterozygous and 0 for homozygous.
And any of the following containing the response (or explanatory) variable used
for modeling by logistic regression in function \code{modelDropout}:
'MethodX', 'Method1', 'Method2', 'MethodL' and 'MethodL.Ph'.
}
\description{
Calculate drop-out events (allele and locus) and records the surviving peak height.
}
\details{
Calculates drop-out events. In case of allele dropout the peak height of the
surviving allele is given. Homozygous alleles in the reference set can be
either single or double notation (X or X X). Markers present in the
reference set but not in the data set will be added to the result.
NB! 'Sample.Name' in 'ref' must be unique core name of replicate sample
names in 'data'.
Use \code{checkSubset} to make sure subsetting works as intended.
There are options to remove sex markers and quality sensors from analysis.

NB! There are several methods of scoring drop-out events for regression.
Currently the 'MethodX', 'Method1', and 'Method2' are endorsed by the DNA
commission (see Appendix B in ref 1). However, an alternative method is to
consider the whole locus and score drop-out if any allele is missing.

Explanation of the methods:
Dropout - all alleles are scored according to AT. This is pure observations
and is not used for modeling.
MethodX - a random reference allele is selected and drop-out is scored in
relation to the the partner allele.
Method1 - the low molecular weight allele is selected and drop-out is
scored in relation to the partner allele.
Method2 - the high molecular weight allele is selected and drop-out is
scored in relation to the partner allele.
MethodL - drop-out is scored per locus i.e. drop-out if any allele has
dropped out.

Method X/1/2 records the peak height of the partner allele to be used as
the explanatory variable in the logistic regression. The locus method L also
do this when there has been a drop-out, if not the the mean peak height for
the locus is used. Peak heights for the locus method are stored in a
separate column.
