Description: An open source platform for validation and process control.
    Tools to analyse data from internal validation of forensic short tandem
    repeat (STR) kits are provided. The tools are developed to provide
    the necessary data to conform with guidelines for internal validation
    issued by the European Network of Forensic Science Institutes (ENFSI)
    DNA Working Group, and the Scientific Working Group on DNA Analysis Methods
    (SWGDAM). A front-end graphical user interface is provided.
