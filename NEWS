Version 1.0.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* NB! Version 1.0.0 includes many fixes and it is recommended to re-import
   and re-analyse previous data.
* New kit file structure pre-loaded with ESI17, ESI17Fast, ESX17, ESX17Fast,
    Y23, Identifiler, NGM, ESSPlexSE (fixed virtual alleles), NGMSElect, SGMPlus
* New functions for creating new kit definitions and edit the kit definition file.
* New functions for analysis of 'bins' and 'panels' files.
* New functions for process control (e.g. contamination).
* New 'database.txt' file including allele frequency databases:
    "SGM Norway", R. Andreassen et al. / Forensic Science International 170 (2007) 59-61
    "ESX 17 Hill", C.R. Hill et al. / Forensic Science International: Genetics 5 (2011) 269-275
* New function for saving plots as various formats.
* Numerous bug fixes and improvements made to the following functions.
  The most significant changes are listed below:
  calculateBalance/calculateBalance_gui
    - Alleles are now filtered and only peaks matching reference are considered.
    - Added calculation of 'delta' i.e. difference in repeat number.
    - Fixed bug when two peaks have identical height.
    - Added a second definition of Hb (HMW/LMW).
    - Additional data checks.
  calculateDropout/calculateDropout_gui
    - Now complies with the recommendations from the ISFG DNA commission.
    - Implemented a scoring threshold (LDT).
    - Multiple scoring methods implemented.
  filterProfile/filterProfile_gui
    - Possible to use 'ref' without 'Sample.Name' column i.e. one profile for all.
    - Does not discard columns anymore.
    - Fixed bug when adding missing loci.
  getKit
    - Changed to support new kit file structure.
    - New parameter 'what' for specifying the information returned.
  import
    - Changed name on some parameters.
    - Progress messages added.
    - Strings "NA" and "" now replaced with NA.
    - All data is imported as character data.
  modelDropout_gui
    - Implemented modelling from several dropout scoring methods.
    - Removed subset modelling because a subset must be scored again.
    - Changed logistic regression in accordance to ref. 2012.
    - Implemented 'Hosmer-Lemeshow test'.
    - Improved control over plot.
  plotBalance_gui
    - New plot option 'Hb by Delta'.
    - Correctly handles different number of markers per dye.
    - Better control over plot elements, and fixed zoom.
  plotDropout_gui
    - New plot options 'plot by sample name' and empirical cumulative distribution plot.
    - Correctly handles different number of markers per dye.
    - Better control over plot elements, and fixed zoom.
  plotStutter
    - Correctly handles different number of markers per dye.
    - Better control over plot elements, and fixed zoom.
  slim
    - Re-written for better performance.
  tableStutter/tableStutter_gui
    - User defined quantile.
  trim/trim_gui
    - Supports dataframe without 'Sample.Name' column.
    - Fixed bug when samples=NULL, and invertS=TRUE.
  calculatePeaks (former countPeaks)
    - Completely re-written.
* Various bug fixes and improvements in functions:
    addData, calculateResultType, colNames, cropData_gui, detectKit,
    editData_gui, export_gui, addColor, sortMarker.
